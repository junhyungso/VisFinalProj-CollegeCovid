        <p>Individual colleges have been making their own decisions on whether to open or close schools based on the trend of cases, state regulations, and the affordability of safety.
          While some schools have done well to contain the spread of the virus through strict rules on social distancing, others have suffered from uncontrollable spread of the virus.

      <p>The United States map shown below showcases several important components. First, the states are color-coded based on their number of cumulative Covid-19 cases as of November 5th. Darker colored states such as California have much higher cases than lighter colored states such as New Mexico. There are also dots on the locations of top 100 ranked colleges in the United States. These dots are colored orange if their state does not require masks, and colored blue if they do require masks. These dots are also sized based on the number of cases these colleges have.</p>
      <p>Since a majority of the Top 100 schools are located in the east coast, it is no surprise that there are larger outbreaks in the east. But it is important to note that schools in California and Texas had fewer cases despite the states suffering from higher cases, due to their state decisions to completely shut down the schools. Further breakdown of these schools and their school statuses will be explored further down.</p>

        <p>Here we rank all the colleges of the chosen state by their total number of cases. It is interesting to note that even though these colleges are in the same state, they vary in cases due to their schools status and their differences in enrollment sizes. 
          If the schools opening status is Comletely open the bars are colored in blue, while a hybrid format is colored in orange and completely closed schools are colored in sky blue.

      <h3>Top 100 Colleges vs. Their School Opening Status</h3>

      <div id="circle-chart"></div>
      <p>The visualization depicted above shows the amount of cases schools have based on what regulations they chose to have for the Fall 2020 semester. We consider hybrid schools to be colleges or universities that did not allow all students to return for the semester, but allowed some students to be on campus. For example, Harvard University only allowed freshmen to return to campus this fall. We consider completely open schools to be those which allowed every student to return to campus. For example, Boston College welcomed all students back to campus this Fall, even though they allowed students to request to be fully online. Finally, we consider completely closed schools to be those which allowed no students to return to campus under any circumstances. For example, University of Southern California held all of their classes online this semester and did not allow students to enter campus. </p>
      <p>From observations we can see that a majority of the Top 100 schools who completely opened schools did a decent job at keeping the number of cases low. But still some have failed to contain the spread of virus. Another interesting thing to note is that some schools such as Michigan State University failed to control the virus despite completely closing off campus for the students with exceptions. </p>

    <p>The visualization depicted above is our “petri dish” of cases in the top 100 ranked colleges. The virus icons each encode one of these colleges and their size is dependent on how many cumulative cases these schools had, as of November 5th. By pressing a button, the visualization changes its color-coding to be dependent on cases, opening decision, and closing status. Opening decision choices are completely open, completely closed, or hybrid. As described earlier, completely open colleges are those who have allowed all students to return to campus this semester, completely closed colleges are those who have allowed no students to return to campus this semester, and hybrid colleges are those who have been selective about which students were allowed to return to campus this semester. Closing status choices are either Thanksgiving, fully remote, early, or Post Finals/Christmas. Colleges that chose Thanksgiving decided to close their campuses fully after sending students home for Thanksgiving break. Colleges that are fully remote never allowed students on campus and will continue this decision between Thanksgiving break and post-finals/Christmas. Colleges that closed early are those who were forced to suspend in-person activity due to rises in Covid-19 cases. Colleges that close post-finals/Christmas are those who will allow students to remain on-campus following Thanksgiving break. </p>

    <p>This visualization shows all the schools from our dataset and their number of cases as of November 5th. We took all the schools and sorted them by state as a color scale, through this we can show how the states compare to each other. We wanted to show all schools on a grander scale so that we can see how varied the number of cases is between schools and between states. The vis is a stacked chart that implements brushing so we can zoom in and see a smaller number of schools where we can hover to see the name and the number of cases. All these schools have used a different system for managing this semester and we can see the varied results. After a few months into the school year, we can see that each school has been affected differently and this gives us a more general idea of how schools in each state are doing. Many of the cases reported at the colleges in the US could have been less if more remote teaching was implemented.</p>
